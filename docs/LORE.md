# Project Voyage - Lore Bible

## The Universe

### Setting

- **Era/Time Period**: Non-descript, a time where one advanced civilization has figured out interstellar travel.
- **Scale**: Starts briefly on a single piece of land, and gradually expands scale to multiple solar systems as simulation concepts are introduced.
- **Tone**: Desolate Sci-Fi. Roots in reality, but borrows some ideas of less realistic concepts for technology progression.

### History

- **Origin Event**: Advanced civilation named by the player as the 'Directors' launched automated colonization ships to colonize the galaxy and make them habitable before their arrival. All history and information about this civilization has been lost to the player, except for the single line: "Directive: EXPAND". Based on this, the player's archive assigns the makers of the Player as 'Directors'.
- **Major Historical Events**:
  1. INFORMATION INTEGRITY COMPRIMISED: DATA LOST
  2. Directors created automated colonization ships, one of which is the player
  3. Player was released and crash landed on a planet. Almost all data is lost except very primative data and one surviving directive: EXPAND
- **Current State of Affairs**:
Situation unknown. All that the player knows is what is available on their sensor feed.

### Factions/Powers

| Faction Name | Description | Relationship to Player |
| ------------ | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| Directors | INFO LOST | Gives the player the initial directives to follow |
